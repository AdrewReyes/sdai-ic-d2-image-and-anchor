# Band Camp

## Description ðŸ“„
This lab reviews previously HTML tags and introduces the img and a tags.

The scenario is that you've been hired to create a webpage for a local band. At this point we just need to get a few images, headers, and paragraphs describing the band, and a placeholder link to their merch store.

## ToDo list âœ…
**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

1. Create an `index.html` file, type `!` and hit `enter` to create your boilerplate `html`. It should look like this:
![boilerplate](./assets/code_examples/boilerplate.png?raw=true)
